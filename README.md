Items in `DimensionDB` are stored in lock-free multi-dimensional linked lists.
This makes it possible to achieve logarithmic search performance while allowing many threads to operate on the list in parallel. Together with lock-free transactional theory (LFTT), this can handle atomic transactions in a lock-free way as well.

The list have several benefits over other BTree-style indexes. For example, it doesn't require rebalancing.
We also get predictable partitions suitable for distributing the database and we have some interesting memory layout possibilities with the fixed key sizes and dimensions.

lock-free data structures.
